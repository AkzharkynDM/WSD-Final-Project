# Application overview:
## Application topic:
Online game store for JavaScript games </br>
## Features of application:
Register as a player and developer </br>
As a developer: add games to their inventory, see list of game sales </br>
As a player: buy games, play games, see game high scores and record their score to it </br>

# Models:
## Game
date_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True) </br>
players = ArrayField(ArrayField(CharField(max_length=64)))

## Developer
name = models.CharField(max_length=64) </br>
earned_money = models.CharField(max_length=64)

## Player
name = models.CharField(max_length=64) </br>
credit_card_info = models.CharField(max_length=64)
inventory_games = models.CharField(max_length=64)

# Views
## Game
1. Play game
2. Update the game with new version, delete game
3. View all games
4. Get the rank of players
5. Get the rank of developers

## Game service
1. Update the rank of players with highest score
2. Get and process messages: save/load game state messages, error messages, messages for configuration changes 

## Developer
1. Profile of developer which shows how much money and which games were done by this developer. Should be visible for develoepr only.
2. Place your game - this page allows developers with put the urls to their games and share it with player.
## Player
1. Profile of player which shows the credit card information and credentials of player. Should be visible for player only.
2. Purchase a game
3. Message other players

# Security threat analysis
The following security issues should be considered during complation of project: 
1. Stealing users' payment data
2. Updating users' credentials
3. Impersonating a player
4. Modifying requests to gaming service as changing the highest score, loading/modiying exsiting games' data
5. Removing game form service, which can be performed by completing developers
6. Stealing developers' payment data
7. Updating develoeprs' credentials
8. Impersonating a developer

# Working methods:
1. Regular face-to-face meetings, Skype conferences, using messaging applications for tracking the progress
2. The verification of code must be done by 1 or 2  members before the user can merge their branch dedicated to one frature into master 
3. Enabling continuous integration (Built-in CI tool ) and deployment (Heroku), where the deployment of app is triggered automatically after the tests have passed successfully. Contunous checking of branches and testing should be enabled.

# Implementation steps:
frontend - initial design with HTML pages will be implemented. After the completion of logic and functionality of app, the improvement on frontend will be done. </br>
backend - this will focus on logic of the full application and will be changed and improved throughout the completion of project. </br>
security - the authentication, storing the userâ€™s bank credentials, the asset for developers will be enabled. Further, the penetration tests will be performed to test the viability, stability and functionality of our application.

# Timetable:
The project needs to be completed by the end of 3rd term. The general milestones are determined as follows: </br>
19.1 - End of backend functionality, proper testing of backend, logic of game </br>
10.2 - Improving the frontend of application, resolving security issues </br>
19.2 - Testing of full application and deploying in Heroku </br>
